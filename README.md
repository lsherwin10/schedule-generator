# schedule-generator

Given a .csv file with a list of seniority tiers for each employee, this program generates a schedule as output to a .csv file. It fills shifts in descending order, leaving the most senior employees with the most shifts, accounts for off days, and accomodates for restrictions on minors who face employment restrictions in the workplace this was designed for.
