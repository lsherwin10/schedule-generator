# schedule-generator

This program generates a schedule for employees given a list of seniority rankings and days off in two .csv files. It fills shifts in descending order, leaving the most senior employees with the most shifts, accounts for off days, and accomodates for restrictions on minors who face employment restrictions in the workplace this was designed for.
